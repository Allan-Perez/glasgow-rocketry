Yesterday some of the GU Rocketry team took part in a joint outreach ‘Space Day’ event with GU Orbitand Stratonauts at Hillhead Highschool. The GUR team helped to deliver a short introduction about space to the students and organised a mission patch designing competition. The winning design is going to become our official mission patch for our upcoming launch and feature on our rocket!
