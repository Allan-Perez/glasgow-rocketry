Glasgow University Rocketry is an initiative founded on the aims to launch Scotlandâ€™s first student-built, high-powered rocket whilst providing invaluable skills to up and coming engineering graduates.

Students can focus on personal aerospace interests by joining one (or multiple) of our specialised teams: Flight Systems, Propulsion, Ground Infrastructure and Aerodynamics. This project enables them to gain an industry-standard skillset early in their career through direct, hands-on experience.

Currently, the preliminary design for our first launch campaign has been completed with the launch planned for September 2020. For our second launch campaign, we have ambitious plans to compete in the Spaceport America Cup in 2021. Additionally, we are also currently working on our initial hybrid engine construction plans.

A launch with Glasgow University Rocketry is a launch for the future of UK Rocketry. Through working with a number of companies we hope to continue to inspire students, encouraging them to get involved in the growing aerospace industry.
