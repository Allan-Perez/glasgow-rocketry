Glasgow University Rockery is an initiative founded on the aims to launch the first student built high-powered rocket in Scotland whilst providing invaluable skills to up and coming engineering graduates. 


The project allows graduates to focus on their own aerospace interests by joiningone of the specialised teams we have (Flight Systems, Propulsion, Ground Infrastructure, Aerodynamics) enabling them to gain an industry standard skillsetearly through their work on a multitude of our projects.


We have currently completed the entire preliminary design for our first launch campaign which is planned to launch September 2020. However, we are always looking to the future with plans for our second launch campaign to compete in the Spaceport America Cup 2021 against the best rocketry teams in world. Furthermore, we are currently working on the design plans for construction of a hybrid engine.


A launch with Glasgow University Rocketry is a launch for the future of UK rocketry and through working with a number of companies we hope to continue to inspire and get graduates involved in the growing aerospace industry.
