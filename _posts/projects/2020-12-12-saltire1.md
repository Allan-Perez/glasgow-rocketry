Yesterday some of the GU Rocketry team took part in a joint outreach ‘Space Day’ event with GU Orbit and Stratonauts at Hillhead Highschool. The GUR team helped to deliver a short introduction about space to the students and asked the students to design mission patches. The winning design is going to become our official mission patch for our upcoming launch and feature on our rocket!
